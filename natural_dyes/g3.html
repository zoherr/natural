          <h2 class="section-title">Why Use Iron Water?</h2><br>
      
          <p>Using iron or rust water is one of the ways to expand your palette of colors. It darkens plant-dyed fibers, making the colors more somber in tone. This section will guide you on making iron water and applying it to your fabric or yarn. Iron, however, is not a food-grade ingredient like soya milk, so use it sparingly, especially considering its effectiveness in pattern making.</p><br>
      
          <h3>What is Iron Water?</h3><br>
      
          <p>Iron water is simply water containing tiny rust particles. Rust forms when iron is exposed to oxygen and moisture over time. When applied to plant-dyed fabrics, rust can change the color through a simple chemical reaction. Iron water increases the light and wash fastness of dyes on cellulose fibers, especially when used with tannin-rich dyes. However, excessive use on animal fibers may weaken them.</p><br>
      
          <h3>Making Iron Water</h3><br>
      
          <ol>
            <li>Take a large glass jar and fill it with water.</li>
            <li>Add pieces of iron to encourage rust formation.</li>
            <li>After a few days, the water will turn orange as rust develops. The longer it sits, the more rust will form. Iron water can be stored in an airtight jar for an extended period.</li>
            <li>Remember to top up the water level when using iron water.</li>
          </ol><br>
      
          <h3>Darkening Plant Dyes with Iron Water</h3><br>
      
          <p>Never let iron water come into contact with aluminum pots, utensils, or rubber gloves used for dyeing, as it can affect future colors. Use a designated vessel for iron water and reserve specific gloves for it.</p><br>
      
          <ol>
            <li>Gently move the iron water jar to mix rust into the water.</li>
            <li>Pour a small amount into a bowl, dilute with fresh water based on your dyeing needs.</li>
            <li>Dip fabric into the bowl; the duration depends on iron water concentration.</li>
            <li>Squeeze out excess liquid, leave to drip dry, and replenish the jar with fresh water.</li>
          </ol><br>
      
          <h3>Safety</h3><br>
      
          <p>Always wear rubber gloves, as iron water is irritating to the skin. Keep it away from children and animals.</p><br>
      
          <h3>Painting with Iron Water</h3><br>
      
          <p>Painting patterns on plant-dyed fabric is an effective use of iron water.</p><br>
      
          <ol>
            <li>Lay dry fabric on cardboard to protect the table.</li>
            <li>Agitate the iron water jar, allowing rust pieces to settle.</li>
            <li>Dip a paintbrush into the water, avoiding floating rust, and paint directly onto the fabric.</li>
            <li>After painting, let the fabric dry and wash it to remove rust residue.</li>
          </ol><br>
      
          <h3>Additional Suggestions:</h3><br>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Experiment with droplets of water on the brush for polka dots.</li>
            <li>Turn droplets into brush strokes for 'teardrop' shapes.</li>
            <li>The more concentrated the iron water, the darker the pattern will likely be.</li>
            <li>Compare the effect of iron water on different dyes, as some react dramatically to it.</li>
          </ul><br>
      
          <h3>How Safe is Iron Water?</h3><br>
      
          <p>While not a food-grade mordant, iron water has a place in natural dyeing. Rust formation is a natural process, and we control it through our chemical reaction. It offers endless possibilities for pattern making. Use it sparingly, and my preferred method is painting patterns with very little iron water for striking results.</p><br>
      
          <h2>Why Color Fastness Matters</h2><br>
      
          <p>If we invest time into dyeing fabric or yarn, we want the colors to last. This section discusses how the final use of a garment may determine which dyes to choose and suggests methods for testing color fastness. Sunlight and washing can cause colors from natural dyes to fade, requiring extra care. Testing color fastness is crucial to understanding how well a dye will hold up over time and usage.</p><br>
      
          <h3>How Will You Use Your Dyed Items?</h3><br>
      
          <p>If you sell dyed textiles, ensuring long-lasting colors is vital. Consider the end useâ€”colors for a cushion cover need to be more lightfast than those for a dress. When dyeing for personal use, experimenting with less permanent dyes can be exciting, embracing the transient nature of colors.</p><br>
      
          <h3>Testing Color Fastness</h3><br>
      
          <p>Conduct tests on new dyes to assess light, wash, and rub fastness, providing crucial information for deciding the end use of dyed fabric or yarn. Different dyes have varying color fastness properties, so tailor your choice based on the item's purpose.</p><br>
