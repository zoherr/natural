        <h2 class="section-title">What about blue and green?</h2><br>
        <p>We will not work with vat dyes such as indigo and woad to produce blues, as these dyes require specialist techniques. Dyeing with vat dyes is easily achievable at home and you may choose to overdye yellows to make colour fast greens. Alternatively you can make green from onion skins and a less colour fast green from carrot tops. A range of grey-blues can be made from berries (which contain anthocyanin pigments); pinks from berries turn blue under tap water due to the pH change, then return to pink in acidic conditions.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>1. Pretreating fibres in soya milk</h3><br>
        <p>Protein fibres such as wool and silk have a natural affinity with plant dyes.</p><br>
        <br><p>When cellulose fibres are soaked in soya milk, the soybean protein coats the fibres and the fibres become more like protein fibres. Cotton that has been pretreated in soya milk adopts some of the qualities of protein fibres and absorbs much more dye than untreated cotton.</p>
        <br><p>Soybeans contain up to 40% protein and there is a component within soya protein that acts as a binding agent. Soya has the ability to bind natural dyes to cloth extremely well, especially if the soya milk mordanted fabric or yarn is left for some time before dyeing to allow the protein to fully bond to the fibres.</p>
        <br><p>Soya mordanting is a centuries old method that has been used in many cultures across the world. Perhaps the most well known example is the Japanese stencil resist dyeing technique of Katazome, where fabric is sized with soya milk, then painted with pigments that have been mixed with soya milk.</p>
        <br><p>Soybean protein is such a good binding agent that even silk can benefit from soya milk treatment. Other sources of protein have potential for binding dyes, ranging from plant proteins from acorns and rice, to animal milks and egg whites.</p>
        
        <br><h3>2. Using a pot as a mordant</h3>
        <br><p>If we decide to avoid using metallic salt mordants such as alum, that doesn't mean that we cannot benefit from the 'mordanting potential' of metals. By simply using an aluminium pot, we will get a similar benefit as mordanting with alum but without handling fine powders. Since we need to use a dye pot of some kind, we may as well choose one with a metal that is useful to us, rather than using stainless steel which is non reactive.</p>
        <br><p>The longer the dye is left in the pot, the more of an influence there is from the metal. I do all my dyeing in aluminium pots and dye slowly for long periods of time to get the maximum benefit from the metal in the pot.</p>
        <br><p>Dye particles are attracted to the side of the pot as dye reacts with the metal. The build up of dye can be washed off with a scouring sponge at the end of each dyeing session. It is this reactive nature of aluminium that we take advantage of when using a pot as a mordant.</p>
        <br><p>I have found some plant dyes to be 'cleansing' and effectively clean oft the build up of dye inside the pot. After dyeing with a dark tannin rich dye, I often boil some dried hibiscus flowers in water to clean my pot.</p>
        <br><p>Aluminium pots are known to help brighten colours and in my experience the metal can often bring out entirely different shades. A dye may begin as a pale yellow and slowly transform into a different colour over the course of a day or two. I've seen this with lavender and rosemary dye, as well as many other leaves and flowers.</p>
        <br><p>Iron and copper pots can also be used for different effects; iron darkens colours and copper enhances yellows. It's fascinating to dye with different kinds of pots to see the wide range of colours that a single plant can yield.</p>
        
        <br><h3>3. Using dyes rich in tannins</h3>
        <br><p>Tannins are naturally occurring compounds found in seeds, leaves, bark and fruit. Tannins are usually yellow or brown in colour and tane bitter. They are found in grapes and play a role in wine making and are responsible for making some types of wine taste bitter. Tannins are alo in tea, in varying amounts, explaining why some types of tea taste more. bitter than others.</p>
        <br><p>Tannins are extremely useful in dyeing as they have the ability to help fix dyes to fibres by acting as mordants. Some tannins are clear coloured (such as those found in oak galls) and light coloured (such as those in pomegranate skins) and can be applied to fibres to improve the colour fastness of other dyes applied afterwards.</p>
        <br><p>Cellulose fabrics can actually be dyed with tannin rich dyes without soya milk mordanting, but the additional step of soya milk treatment undoubtedly produces much deeper shades.</p>
        <br><p>Dyes which contain high levels of tannins certainly produce reliable and long-lasting colours which are essential qualities when selling dyed textiles, but it is still worth experimenting with other potentially less colour fast dyes. I try not to become so preoccupied with colour fastness that I am scared to experiment with plants that do not contain tannins in case the colour fades. It is fun to try new plants, especially when dyeing fabric for personal use. The topic of colour fastness is explored further .</p>
        
        <br><h3>4. Time</h3>
        <br> <p>The longest lasting colours come when plenty of time has been spent on the entire process. It is worth emphasising that time' does not equal
'effort'; many of the processes in this book take a long time, but require little effort. The processes simply need to be set up and monitored and left for a period of time for full effect.</p>
<br><p>I usually have several projects on the go at once at various stages and do a little bit of everything every day. At any one time, I may have fabric or yarn soaking in a bucket of soya milk, a pot of dye on the stove either heating or soaking, a pile of fabric in the cupboard that has been treated with soya milk and other fabric waiting to be rinsed and washed after dyeing.</p>
<br><p>It is worth keeping a stash of soya milk treated fabric or yarn ready for impromptu dyeing sessions. After mordanting, the fibres are best left for a minimum of a week before dyeing, ideally longer. The soya protein becomes part of the fibres and time is needed for this process to take place.</p>
<br><p>Preparing a dye bath also takes time and this can rarely be done in a single day. Colours take time to fully extract from plants and then the fibres take time to absorb and bond with the dye. Generally, the longer you spend on each step, the better the results will be.</p>
<br><p>Plant dyeing is a slow process and it is this very aspect that I love most; it is an antidote to a hectic life. The process is just as enjoyable as the final result and I savour every moment. In my opinion, the colours from nature are far superior to synthetic colours, so the time is well worth spending.</p>
        
<br><h3>Choosing dye plants</h3>
<br><p>Almost every plant has some kind of colour potential, although some plants produce stronger and more colour fast dyes than others.</p>
<br><p>Some plants that contain dye pigments can be identified by their latin names which often include tinctoria, such as Rubia tinctoria (madder) and Anthemis tinctoria (chamomile). However, many of the plants in this book are not traditional dye plants, so this section offers some suggestions for choosing plants that give promising results in the dye pot.</p>
        
<br><h3>Storing plants</h3>
<br><p>Plants may produce different colours depending on whether they are used fresh or dry. I like to store dried plants in cardboard boxes to let the air flow and prevent mildew forming. You may choose to freeze some dyestuffs, although I try to avoid freezing too much due to the cost of running the freezer but I sometimes freeze flowers.</p>
<br><p>If you would like to make dye from fresh plants but don't have any mordanted fabric or yarn, you can make concentrated dye (by using very little water) and store it in an airtight jar in the fridge until you are ready to use it. Then pour it into the dye pot and add as much extra water as you need.</p>
        
<br><h3>Plants with scent</h3>
<br><p>My favourite tip for identifying promising dye plants comes from India Flint, who recommends looking out for plants with a scent. This indicates the presence of aromatic oils and acids which suggests that the plant has dye potential.</p>
<br><p>Eucalyptus is a perfect example of this; the leaves contain eucalyptus oil and they certainly produce spectacular colours in the dye pot. Other examples include bay leaves and lavender, but of course many other herbs.</p>
<br><p>To see if you have extracted as much dye as possible into the water, simply take a leaf out of the dye pot and smell it. If it no longer has any scent then you have probably extracted all of the available colour. But if it still smells, try heating it in fresh water to extract even more colour, then combine the two lots of dye.</p>
        
<br><h3>Colour variation</h3>
<br><p>There are so many factors involved in plant dyeing that there is no guarantee that you will get the same colour twice. This can be frustrating when trying to replicate colours but it is also one of the most exciting aspects of plant dyeing. There is always an element of surprise!</p>
<br><p>The location where the plant is grown can affect the colour outcome (soil, water and weather conditions) as well as the time of year and how mature the plant is. Even when dyeing with your favourite plants, there is always an element of uncertainty. I have noticed that Hass avocado skins produce slightly different shades throughout the year. Nettles produce any colour from light grey to olive green. Plant dyeing on holiday can give surprising results due to the different tap water and growing conditions of plants.</p>
        
<br><h3>Plants in the wild</h3>
<br><p>Naturally, our place in the world will determine exactly which plants grow locally. You may find that you question the dyeing potential of almost every plant you come across which adds a stimulating new element to local walks. Through research and exploration you will become an expert on your local dye plants and your colours will be unique to your region.</p>
<br><p>It is important to find out the name of any plant you may wish to use and to check that it is not poisonous. Some plants may be toxic when ingested, which is especially dangerous when children collect plants. With other plants, the fumes from the dye pot may be harmful to inhale, most notably in the case of rhubarb leaves which contain oxalic acid.</p>
<br><p>Remember that plants are part of a delicate ecosystem and we must respect this when collecting from the wild. Here are some things that I like to keep in mind when foraging for plants:</p>
<br><ul>
    <br><li>Collect wind fallen plant matter first and then weeds that grow invasively.</li>
    <br><li>As a guide, do not pick more than 10% of flowers, berries or leaves.</li>
    <br><li>Remember that small creatures depend on flowers and berries for their sustenance.</li>
    <br><li>It's important to leave enough flowers so they can self-seed the following season.</li>
    <br><li>Only remove bark from fallen branches (e.g, after a storm). Peeling of too much bark from the trunk can actually kill trees.</li>
