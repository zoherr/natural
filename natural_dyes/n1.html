        <h2 class="section-title">Dyeing with whole dyestuffs</h2><br>
        <p>In this website we will dye with 'whole dyestuffs' which means that we will use whole plants, either fresh or
          dried. I'll show you how to exploit the colour potential of plants that grow in the wild, garden herbs,
          kitchen waste, as well as fruit and vegetables that you can buy from the supermarket. There is colour
          potential all around us waiting to be used!</p><br>

        <h3>Different types of plant dye</h3><br>
        <p>There are different types of plant dye and they bond to the fibres in different ways.</p>
        <ol><br>
          <li>
            <p>Substantive dyes, such as pomegranate skins, avocado stones and tea contain substances called tannins
              which act as a natural mordant and help bond the dyes to the fibres.</p><br>
            <ul>
              <li>A sub-category of substantive dyes is vat dyes, which include indigo and woad. These require a
                reduction agent to remove the oxygen to make the dye soluble in water in order for the dye to bond with
                fibres, and are beyond the scope of this book.</li><br>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Adjective dyes, such as dyes from flowers and berries, need help from another substance, known as a
            mordant, to bind the dye to fibres.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>Without a mordant the colours will not last long.</p><br>

        <h3>Different types of fibre</h3><br>
        <p>Fibres are either of protein or cellulose origin.</p><br>
        <ol>
          <li>Cellulose fibres, such as cotton, linen, hemp and bamboo viscose, come from plants and need assistance
            from a mordant to bind with plant dyes. Without mordanting, the colours are usually pale and wash out
            quickly.</li><br>
          <li>Protein fibres, such as wool, silk and soybean, have a natural affinity with plant dyes and readily
            absorb colour. In general terms it can be said that they do not require mordanting. Protein fibres are
            usually from animals, although soybean fibre is an exception. I choose to work with vegan fibres so the
            only protein fibres in this book are from soybeans.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Mordants</h3><br>
        <p>A mordant is a substance that assists with the bond between the dye and fibre. Cellulose fibres, like
          cotton, need some assistance in order to be successfully dyed with plants.</p><br>
        <p>The main mordant used in this website is soybean protein in the form of soya milk. Cellulose fibres soaked
          in soya milk absorb some of the soy protein, which changes the properties of the fibres so they become
          similar to protein fibres. Like naturally occuring protein fibres, cellulose fibres that have been pretreated
          with soya milk then have a natural affinity to plant dyes. These mordanted fibres will absorb more dye which
          results in darker colours which are also more colour fast. The soybean protein increases the bond between the
          fibre and the dye.</p><br>
        <p>Many dyes also contain natural mordants in the form of tannins. By using a combination of the soya milk
          mordanting method and tannin rich dyes, we can achieve long-lasting and most importantly 100% natural
          colours.</p><br>

        <h3>Why I don't use alum</h3><br>
        <p>Alum is a popular mordant and is widely known as the 'least toxic metallic salt mordant. However, it must be
          noted that aluminium is in fact a toxin to the human body. When handling alum, a dust mask is advisable and
          care should be taken to not inhale the acidic vapours from the dye pot. Without a doubt there are potential
          health risks from working with alum. I find the soya milk mordanting method produces better results in terms
          of colour fastness, so I feel no need to use alum again.</p><br>
